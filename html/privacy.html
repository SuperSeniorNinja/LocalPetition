  General information Provision of data For a use of our website is usually neither legally nor contractually required to provide personal data. If the provision of data is necessary for the conclusion of a contract or if the user is obliged to provide personal data, we will inform you of this circumstance and the consequences of not providing it in this data protection declaration. Data transfer to third countries It is possible that we use service providers and third parties located in countries outside the European Union and the European Economic Area. The transfer of personal data to such third countries is based on an adequacy decision of the European Commission (Article 45 GDPR) or we have provided appropriate safeguards to ensure data protection (Article 46 GDPR). Insofar as an adequacy decision of the European Commission exists for the transfer of data to a third country, we point this out in this privacy policy. In all other respects, users may obtain a copy of the appropriate safeguards, if not already included in the privacy statements of the service providers or third parties, from us. Automated decision-making If we use automated decision-making, including profiling, we will inform you in this privacy statement about this circumstance, the logic involved, and the scope and intended effects of such processing. Otherwise, automated decision-making does not take place. Processing for other purposes Data is generally only processed for the purposes for which it was collected. If, exceptionally, they are to be further processed for other purposes, we will inform you about these other purposes prior to such further processing and provide all other relevant information (Art. 13 (3) DSGVO). Website hosting Each time our website is called up, the user's browser transmits various data. For the duration of the visit to the website, the following data are processed and stored in log files even beyond an end of the connection: Browser type and version used Operating system Pages and files accessed Amount of data transferred Date and time of access User's provider IP address in anonymized form Referrer URL The processing of this data is necessary in order to be able to deliver the website to the user and to optimize it for his end device.

    HOW DO YOU PROCESS PERSONAL DATA?
    We save and use your personal data only to process your orders and to get in touch with you. If you subscribe to our customer newsletter, we also use your email address to send it out. We will automatically send you status messages from hetzner-status.de if you have previously changed your settings on our customer administration interface in which you request these messages. We also save and process data that job applicants provide us as part of the job application process.
    
    <br> <br>
    WHAT CATEGORIES OF DATA DO WE COLLECT?
    Every time you visit our website, your IP address and other pieces of information are saved in anonymized form. If you register an account with us, your contact information will be stored. If you order products from us, your address and payment information will also be stored.
    
    <br> <br>
    In particular, we save the following data from you.
    <br> <br>
    
    REGISTRATION DATA
    When you register an account with us, we collect and process certain personal data from you as your registration data. For example, we need your name, address information, telephone number, payment information and your email address to process your order. If you pay using a credit card, we do not collect and store any payment information such as credit card numbers or verification codes. You disclose this information only to the respective payment service provider. One exception with credit card payments is what is known as the pseudo card number: in order for you not to have to enter your credit card information for every payment, a pseudo card number is saved for your account. The pseudo card number only enables payment for products on our website that you order using your customer account. A pseudo card number is not identical to the credit card number. We delete all your registration data either: within 24 months, as soon as you delete your user account with us, or once the statutory retention period expires. You can delete your user account with us by sending an email to data-protection@hetzner.com with your deletion request. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR.
    
    <br> <br>
    EMAIL ADDRESSES
    If you subscribed to our newsletter, if someone invited you to a Hetzner Cloud project, or if you requested that you receive automated messages from hetzner-status.com, we also store your email address. We will delete your email address once you delete your user account or if you unsubscribe from our newsletter.
    
    We use the double opt-in method to ensure that you actually want to receive the newsletter. If you go through this process, you agree to receive the newsletter and to be added to the mailing list for it, and then you will receive a confirmation email that will allow you to legally confirm that you have registered for the newsletter. We will only add your name to the mailing list if you actually complete the confirmation.
    
    We use these data exclusively for sending information that you request including information about our new offers.
    
    We use Sendinblue as our newsletter software. So if you agree to register for the newsletter, we will send your data to Sendinblue GmbH. Sendinblue is prohibited from selling your data and from using it for purposes other than sending our newsletter. Sendinblue is a German certified provider whom we chose because they must comply with the requirements of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG).
    <br> <br>
    You can find more information on Sendinblue here:
    https://www.sendinblue.com/legal/termsofuse/?rtype=n2go
    <br> <br>
    You can revoke your consent at any time to the storage of your personal data (including your email address) and to the use of your data. You can do this, for example, by clicking on the "Unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The legal basis for processing your data for the above purpose is Art. 6 (1) lit. a or Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR.
    
    <br> <br>
    SERVER LOG FILES
    Whenever you visit our websites, we automatically store certain data. This includes your IP address, type and version of the browser you use, time, date, website from which you come to our site. Your IP address is saved anonymized. You can then no longer be identified. The legal basis for this data process is Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.
    <br> <br>
    
    FORUM
    If you register for our online discussion forum, we save your username and email address. After you delete your account in the forum, this saved data will also be deleted. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR.
    
    <br> <br>
    CAREER PORTAL
    If you send us job application documents such as your resume, references and cover letter, we will save and process these pieces of data. Application documents from job applicants that do not result in hires are deleted after 6 months. If you wish to be considered for future job openings and you consent to a longer storage period, your application documents will be deleted after 24 months. With applications that result in hires, the documents are forwarded to our HR department. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the job application process is primarily Section 26 of the German Data Protection Act (BDSG) in the new version, which became valid on May 25, 2018.
    <br> <br>
    
    SWEEPSTAKES
    We sometimes have sweepstakes on our websites for various occasions. If you choose to participate in the sweepstakes, we save your first and last names, your email address and, if applicable, the country you come from. We use the collected data only to process the sweepstakes. Once the sweepstakes end and the winner or winners are chosen and notified, the collected data are deleted. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR.
    <br> <br>
    
    WEBSITE ANALYSIS
    On our website, we use the open-source web analysis tool Matomo on our self-hosted system. Matomo uses cookies. These are text files that are saved on your computer and which allow Matomo to analyze how you use our website. The cookies generate information about how you use the website, and our server saves this information. Before we save your cookie information, we anonymize your IP address.
    <br> <br>
    The legal basis for this type of data processing is Art. 6 para 1 lit. f GDPR.
    
    We do not send to third parties the data that the cookies generate about how you use our website. You can prevent the software from generating cookies by changing the settings of your internet browser. However, if you do this, you may not be able to use all of the functions on our website.
    
    If you do not want us to save and use your data using Matomo, you can deactivate it by clicking here: 
    Your internet browser will create an opt-out cookie, which will prevent the Matomo software from creating a cookie when you visit our website.
    
    <br> <br>

    <br> <br>

    COOKIES AND THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO DIRECT ADVERTISING
    "Cookies" are small files that are stored on a user's computer. Cookies can store different kinds of data. Cookies are primarily used to store information about users. They are stored on the users' devices during and/or after users visit a website or online store. "Temporary cookies", "session cookies", or "transient cookies" are cookies that are deleted after users leave an online store and close their browsers. With such cookies, for example, the content of a shopping basket can be stored in an online shop or a login bottleneck. However, other cookies are referred to as "permanent" or "persistent" and remain stored even after the browser is closed. For example, users' login status can be saved when they visit a shop after several days. Likewise, permanent cookies can measure the "range" of a website (where the users are geographically located) or information on the users' interests. This information is used for marketing purposes. "Third-party cookies" are cookies that are offered by the original providers (who operate the online store or website) to other parties. (If the original provider is the one using the cookies, they are often called "first-party cookies"). It is useful to know the above terms so that you understand our cookie policies and data protection agreement. If, as a Hetzner Online GmbH customer or as a visitor to our websites or interfaces, you do not wish cookies to be stored on your computer, we ask you to deactivate the corresponding option in the system settings of your browser. You can also delete stored cookies in the system settings of your browser. However, if you do these things, it will likely lead to problems when you try to use Hetzner Online GmbH websites and interfaces. If you would like to "opt out" of the use of cookies for online marketing and tracking purposes, you may be interested these two sites to help you:
    1) the US site http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
    2) the EU site http://www.youronlinechoices.com/.
    Furthermore, you can deactivate cookies from being stored on your computer or device by changing your browser settings. However, if you do this, it will likely lead to problems when you try to use Hetzner Online GmbH websites, interfaces, and features on the interfaces.
